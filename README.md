# Analysis of Ironman Triathlon Results
I have extended my ability to perform data analytics in Python through the Cambrisge Spark Level 4 Data Analytics Bootcamp. I have delved more deeply into data cleaning, visualisation and analysis; these skills have been applied extensively during the analysis of the triathlon dataset.
 - Pandas DataFrames for storing severeal millions of rows of data
 - Pandas and functions used to clean the data
 - Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh used to visualise
 - Scikitlearn used to model the time-based data

While the data has been cleaned fully, the analysis and visualisation of this dataset remains a work in progress. The notebook detailing this analysis will continue to be updated.
